# Hangman 2 

With hangman 2 we were being taught basic conditional logic.

### To run:

Download the repo and run python3 hangman.py. Ensure that the short_words.txt file is in the same directory as the hangman.py file.

When prompted, input your guess for the missing letter. The game will now tell you if you were correct.
