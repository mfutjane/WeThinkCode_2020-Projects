# Hangman 3

The final iteration completed the game, adding loops to the previous iteration. This allowed the game to count turns, hide all but 1 letter, and modify the clue as the user guessed certain letters correctly.

### To use

- Download the repo and run python3 hangman.py. 
- Input a valid file name for your prefered word list (leave empty to use the default.)
- Input a guess for any missing letter until your turns run out or you guess the word correctly.
