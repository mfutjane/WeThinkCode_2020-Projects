# Pyramid

Pyramid was a one-off project that allowed the user to print multiple shapes (pyramid, triangle, diamond, square) on the console. It was an exercise in logic and flow of a program.

### To run

Download the repo and run python3 draw.py. Enter a valid shape, a height > 0, and whether or not to draw only the outline of the shape.
